-----------------------------Pricing / Rewards Schedule (V1.0.0)---------------------------------
Ground Rules:
1) BTC Balance is marked as either Transferrable (T) or Non-Transferrable (NT)
  A) Transferrable bitcoins can be withdrawn at pleasure to bitcoin wallet after 0.001 or whatever.
  B) Non-transferrable bitcoins can only be used to purchase account features.
  C) When purchasing an account feature, the non-transferrable BTC are used FIRST ALWAYS.
2) BTC can be deposited into account - these are ALWAYS transferrable, and NEVER charged a fee.
3) Be VERY CLEAR to explain to the user that most of these rules are:
  A) Incentives!
  B) Success on practice site is paid in REAL BTC. Use them to invest and make REAL USD.
  C) Costs are mostly in place to avoid spam and to encourage user NOT to give up on an account
  D) WHY I can give such generous payments for success - because I use that data for research
4) Goal of Pricing / Rewards Schedule:
  A) Profit should always be positive - user should never take more than they give (count adverts)
  B) Payment of a reasonable amount in BTC (above minimum) should be attainable after no more
     than one 10% increment

-On create a new account (requires a new, unregistered BTC address):
++0.1 non-transferrable BTC credit to account (i.e., cannot be withdrawn - only used on site)
++On first purchase of BTC to account, for every 0.01 BTC (transferrable) deposited into account,
    match with 0.01 BTC (non-transferrable) account credit.
-Practice Accounts:

++Upon opening, 2 pBTC are automatically credited to practice account - this is the base investment
++More pBTC can be purchased for a cost of 0.001 BTC / 1 pBTC
++Every 10% gain on website results in a REAL BTC balance added to user's account:
  A) For visible accounts where I harvest their information, 0.0002 BTC.
  B) For invisible accounts, 0.00005 BTC.
++Every 100% gain on website results in additional incentive bonus:
