//  Purpose: Store a user trade in the database when the user has purchased some amount of BTC.
//  When the user requests funds, post that request here.
//  Also, when admin fulfills a trade, remove said trade from the database.
//  The admin can also AJAX request a list of pending transactions, in that case, echo it back to him.

// Note:
//  There will be two separate databases, pending.dat and archive.dat for this.
//  pending.dat holds all of the pending requests that have not been fulfilled,
//  archive.dat holds ALL of the requests, pending or fulfilled, along with a status (pending, accepted, denied)
//  Archive.dat is used in case of system failure.

// Upon launch of site, this will be automated
